## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. While mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
